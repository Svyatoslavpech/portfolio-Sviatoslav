                    <p>
                        In my free time from my main job, I like to do coaching. 
                        For me, it is rest, creativity, and energy. 
                        I was trained by the famous American trainers Stephen Gilligan and Robert Dilts. 
                        I am happy to put my knowledge into practice.

                    With one of my clients, Lena, we worked on her relationship with her father. 
                    Lena had a difficult childhood. 
                    Her dad drank alcohol and fought with Lena's mother. 
                    Lena had a hard time with it and remembered this for her whole life. 
                    We worked on her relationship with her father and she got a good result.

                    </figure>
                    I met Irina by chance. 
                    I advertised on the Internet, she came across it and became interested. 
                    She did not have good relationships with men in the past. 
                    She suffered greatly from it. Irina wanted better relationships. 
                    And in the process of working with her, 
                    we found that in her childhood Irina was greatly affected by her Dad leaving the family. 
                    It affected her entire future life. 
                    It took us a few coaching classes to help Irina improve her relationship with her dad. 
                    As a result, this changed her relationships with men. We got a good result.
